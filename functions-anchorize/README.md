# anchorize

[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/anchorize/)

To follow this example:
1. Read `layouts/_default/list.html`.
2. Run `hugo` on this folder.
3. Read `public/index.html`.

## Differences to the Docs version

The example was expanded to show a short example of how would one use `anchorize`, that is, to use headers as anchors to different parts of the page.

# Notes

The Docs reference the BlackFriday markdown renderer, but the current default is Goldmark. What does this mean for `anchorize`? Should the Docs be changed?
