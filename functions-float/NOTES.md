# float

[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/float)

## Differences to the Docs version

* Add some formating of floats with printf. Could be removed, but otherwise someone who is working with floats will have to go to the Go docs to find out how to do it.

## Notes
The fact that it accepts ints and strings is not documented.
