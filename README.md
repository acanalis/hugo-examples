# hugo-examples

A repository of Hugo examples as shown in the Hugo Docs, so that you can run them yourself. Not maintained by the Hugo Team.

## Notes

* An example is any directory that has a `README.md` file.
* The directory structure mimics [this folder](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs/tree/master/content/en) from the Hugo Docs.
