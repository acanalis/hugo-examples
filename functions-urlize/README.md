# urlize

[Original Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/urlize/)

To follow this example:
1. Run `hugo` on this folder.
2. View `layouts/list.html`.
3. View `public/blog/index.html`.

## Differences to the Docs version

* The original was `{{ . | urlize }}` , but it was changed to `{{ urlize . }}` to match the function signature.
* The taxonomy link was altered from `<a href="/locations/{{ urlize . }}">` to `<a href="/location/{{ urlize . }}">` to keep the config simple.

# Notes

* The examples shows a relatively bad practice of url-building by joining the different parts. There might be better alternatives.
* This examples adds the complexity of a taxonomy.
* The function should be explicitly passed string arguments, without using the dot.
* This function is very simmilar to `anchorize`, so it should be linked in the "See Also".
