# group

[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/group/)

## Differences with the Docs version

Reduced the numbers to avoid generating so many content files.

## Notes

* Could avoid use of partial.
* What is the use case for group? The example shows manual grouping. I can't imagine why someone would do it.
