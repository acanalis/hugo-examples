# delimit

[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/delimit/)

## Differences with the Docs version

* Conversion to yaml.

## Notes

* The article contains (to the effect of) two signatures.
* The toml front matter was mixed with yaml syntax. (bug)
* The map behavior was mentioned, but an example could be added.
* The front matter could be avoided in the first examples, then used in an advanced one. 
* The use of taxonomies and multiple files could be avoided, at least in the simple example.
