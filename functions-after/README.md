# after

[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/after/)

To follow this example:
1. Read `layouts/index`
2. Run `hugo`
3. Read `public/index.html`
4. Read `layouts/section/articles.html`
5. Read `public/articles/index.html`

## Notes

The second example is very interesting, but could be in a different place of the Docs.
