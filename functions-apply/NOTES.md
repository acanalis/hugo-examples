[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/apply/)

## Differences to the Docs version

* The docs have many versions of the example. The clearest one was chosen.
* Conversion to `yaml`. 

# Notes

* The examples shows a relatively bad practice of url-building by joining the different parts. There are be better alternatives.
* The simple example could be related to the first one, for consistency. 
* The pipe in urlize could avoided.
* This example is very similar to the urlize example. They should both be minimal and independent.
* The toml and yaml syntax are mixed.
