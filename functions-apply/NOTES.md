[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/apply/)

## Differences to the Docs version

* The docs have many versions of the example. The clearest one was chosen.
* Conversion to `yaml`. 

# Notes

* Url-building. The taxonomies URLs are built by joining strings. If the taxonomies are rendered on a different part of the site via the "permalink" config option, the links will break. Right now, there's no better option.
* The simple example could be related to the first one, for consistency. 
* The pipe in urlize could avoided.
* This example is very similar to the urlize example. They should both be minimal and independent.
* The toml and yaml syntax are mixed.
