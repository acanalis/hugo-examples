# after

[Original Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/after/)

To follow this example:
1. View `layouts/index`
2. Run `hugo`
3. View `public/index.html`
4. View `layouts/section/articles`
5. View `public/articles/index.html`

## Notes

The second example is very interesting, but could be in a different place of the Docs.
