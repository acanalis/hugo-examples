# abslangurl

[Original Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/absurl/)

To follow this example:
1. Run `hugo` on this folder.
2. View `layouts/list.html`.
3. View `public/index.html`.

## Differences to the Docs version

The example was expanded to show a short example of how would one use `anchorize`, that is, to use headers as anchors to different parts of the page.
