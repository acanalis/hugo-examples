# append

[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/append/)

To follow this example:
1. Read `layouts/list.html`.
2. Run `hugo` on this folder.
3. Read `public/index.html`.

## Notes

The signature has the piping syntax ( the `|` in `COLLECTION | append VALUE [VALUE]...`) and this should be turned to `append COLLECTION VALUE [VALUE]...`
for consistency.
