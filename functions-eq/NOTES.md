# eq

[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/eq)

## Notes

* The example is needlessly long to showcase. It's easier to compare numbers, then strings. The application to detect the current page as "blog" is misplaced here. 
* Does eq do type coersion? The example comparison is of type `.Section` and type `string`. Such details aren't documented.
