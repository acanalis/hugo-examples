# first

[Original Hugo Docs Article](https://gohugo.io/functions/first/)

## Notes

* It's easy to show this function without using the other concepts of folder structure, summary template, among others.
* The suggested folder structure is awkward. The easiest idea to undestand is "folder structure of content = of layouts = output". The use of "section" breaks that logic. 
Suggested structure: 
    ```
    layouts
     └───index.html
     └───articles
          └───baseof.html
          └───single.html
          └───list.html
    ```
